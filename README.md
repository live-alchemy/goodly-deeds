## Welcome to the Advent of Goodly Deeds!

ðŸŽ€

A React/ES6/Local Storage/[Bulma](bulma.io)/[Bulma React Components](https://github.com/couds/react-bulma-components)/SASS/[DayJS](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs) powered advent calendar offering a good deed per day.

### How it works:

When first loaded in a browser, the advent calendar assigns one good deed per day from a predefined list to local storage.
Subsequent runs load the calendar that belongs to that browser. This ensures each browser has a unique calendar.
Only on a given day can the good deed for that day be accessed via the UI. Days in the passed show the image for that day.
